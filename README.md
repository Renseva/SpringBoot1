# SpringBoot1

Only started learning Spring Boot, and done these steps so far:
* Created initial MySQL database using MySQL with tables listing books and would be ratings. 
Tried to mysqldump but couldn't resolve access denied in time. Included screenshots instead.
* Created a Spring Boot app to create a copy of an empty table (code along attempt). It failed to build, and I failed to fix it in time..
